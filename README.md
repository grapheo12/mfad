# MFAD

It will be a notifier (through Email/Calendar) about upcoming Assignment deadlines.


# Development

It's in Design stage now.

Design ideas are welcome.

See the issue #1 for design discussions.

## Ideas to ponder

- [ ] Is it worth automating the process for all modes of communication (Moodle, Teams, Emails, etc.)?
- [ ] Is using volunteer/representatives for each subject reliable?
- [ ] Should we use Calendar Invites or Emails to notify subscribers?
- [ ] Tech stack and mailing service to use.
