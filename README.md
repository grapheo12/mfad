## Ideas to ponder

[x] Is it worth automating the process for all modes of communication (Moodle, Teams, Emails, etc.)?

[x] Is using volunteer/representatives for each subject reliable?

[x] Should we use Calendar Invites or Emails to notify subscribers?

[x] Tech stack and mailing service to use.
